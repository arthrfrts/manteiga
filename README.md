Manteiga is a simple, all-purpose blog theme. It supports all post types and includes a set of versatile theme options, a beautiful sticky sidebar with quick access to your menu items, and two areas for custom content. It's inspired by the design of my own blog, [PÃ£o com Mortadela](https://paomortadela.com.br/).

**Features:**

- Supports all post types
- A set of theme options available on Customize.
- A twitter widget to display your tweets in the sidebar.
- Sticky search and menu in index pages.
- Two custom areas for custom content: one in the sidebar, and another in the footer.
